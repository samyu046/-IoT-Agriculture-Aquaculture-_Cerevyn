DATA FLOW EXPLANATION

1. Sensors collect soil and water parameters.
2. ESP32 reads sensor data and publishes it using MQTT over Wi-Fi.
3. Edge gateway subscribes to MQTT topics and receives sensor data.
4. Edge gateway applies basic threshold checks and generates alerts if required.
5. Processed data is sent to the cloud server using REST APIs.
6. Dashboard fetches the latest data from the cloud and displays sensor values and alerts.

This flow demonstrates edge-to-cloud communication in an IoT system.
