SENSOR LIST AND JUSTIFICATION

1. Soil Moisture Sensor
Used to measure the water content in soil. Helps in determining when irrigation is required in agriculture.

2. Temperature Sensor
Used to monitor ambient temperature which affects crop growth and evaporation rate.

3. pH Sensor
Used to measure water acidity or alkalinity in aquaculture systems. Abnormal pH levels can harm aquatic life.

4. Dissolved Oxygen (DO) / Turbidity Sensor (Simulated)
Used to indicate water quality in aquaculture. Low oxygen or high turbidity can affect fish health.

These sensors were selected because they directly influence decision-making in agriculture and aquaculture monitoring systems.
